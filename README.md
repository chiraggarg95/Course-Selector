# Course-Selector

## Steps to be followed

1. Update all the csv files containing the dept-wise course list (present in the "dept_courses_csv" directory)
2. Run "course_sorter_merged.ipynb" from root directory only upto the point where it saves the dataframe as csv (give an appropriate name to the csv file)
3. Run "filter.ipynb" from root directory. Put in the correct name of the mega csv file (name used in the previous step). 
4. This will ask the filters you require and their respective values.
5. The code is not much robust at the moment, so don't try out boundary cases !!! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
